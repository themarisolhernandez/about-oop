    "# Inheritance and Polymorphism\n",
    "Inheritance and polymorphism are the core concepts of OOP that enable efficient and consistent code reuse. Learn how to inherit from a class, customize and redefine methods, and review the differences between class-level data and instance-level data.\n",

    "## Instance and class data <a name=\"one\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Principles of OOP\n",
    "#### Inheritance:\n",
    "- Extending functionality of existing code\n",
    "#### Polymorphism:\n",
    "- Creating a unified interface\n",
    "#### Encapsulation:\n",
    "- Building of data and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance-level data\n",

    "        emp2 = Employee(\"Marta Popov\", 65000)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name`, `salary` are *instance attributes*\n",
    "- `self` binds to an instance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class-level data\n",
    "- But what if you needed to store some data that is shared among all instances of a class?\n",
    "    - E.g. What if you wanted to introduce a minimal salary across the entire org?\n",
    "- Class-level data is data shared among all instances of a class\n",
    "- Define *class attributes* in the body of `class`,\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use `self` to *define* class attribute\n",
    "- Instead use `ClassName.ATTR_NAME` to *access* the class attribute value\n",

    "### Why use class attributes?\n",

    "- minimal/maximal values for attributes\n",
    "- commonly used values and constance, e.g. `pi` for a `Circle` class\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class methods\n",
    "- Methods are already \"shared\": same code for every instance\n",
    "    - Only difference is the data that is fed into it\n",
    "- Class methods can use instance-level data\n",
    "- To define a class method, you start with a class method decorator, followed by a method definition\n",
    "\n",
    "        class MyClass:\n",
    "\n",
    "            @classmethod                               # <--- use decorator to declare a class method\n",

    "                # Can't use any instance attributes :(\n",

    "\n",
    "        MyClass.my_awesome_method(args...)\n",
    "\n",
    "- So why should we ever need class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative constructors\n",
    "- Main use case is alternative constructors\n",
    "- A class can have only one `__init__` method, but there might be multiple ways to initialize an object\n",
    "- E.g. We may want to create an `Employee` object from data stored in a file\n",
    "    - We can't use a method, because that would require an instance and there isn't one yet\n",
    "    - In the following, we introduce class method `from_file` that accepts a file name, reads the first line that presumably contains the name of the employee, and returns an object instance\n",
    "    - In the return statement we use the `cls` variable, remember that this refers to the class, so this line will call the `__init__(...)` constructor just like `Employee()` would outside the class definition\n",
