    "# Integrating with Standard Python\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn how to make sure that objects that store the same data are considered equal, how to define and customize string representations of objects, and even how to create new error types. Through interactive exercises, youâ€™ll learn how to further customize your classes to make them work more like standard Python data types.\n",
