    "# Best Practices of Class Design\n",
    "How do you design classes for inheritance? Does Python have private attributes? Is it possible to control attribute access? You'll find answers to these questions (and more) as you learn class design best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Designing for inheritance and polymorphism <a name=\"one\"></a>\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "- Using a unified interface to operate on objects of different classes\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bank](imgs/inheritance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### All that matters is the interface\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Withdraw amount from each of accounts in list_of_accounts\n",
    "        def batch_withdraw(list_of_accounts, amount):\n",
    "            for acct in list_of_accounts:\n",
    "                acct.withdraw(amount)\n",
    "        b, c, s = BankAccount(1000), CheckingAccount(2000), SavingsAccount(3000)\n",
    "        batch_withdraw([b, c, s])    # <--- Will use BankAccount.withdraw(), CheckingAccount.withdraw(), SavingsAccount.withdraw()\n",
    "\n",
    "- `bath_withdraw()` doesn't need to check the object to know whifh `withdraw()` to call\\\n",
    "\n",
    "### Liskov substitution principle\n",
    "- Base class should be interchangeable with any of its subclasses without altering any properties of the program\n",
    "- Wherever `BankAccount` works, `CheckingAccount` should work as well\n",
    "- Syntactically\n",
    "    - function signatures are compatible\n",
    "        - arguments, returned values\n",
    "- Sementically\n",
    "    - the state of the object and thr program remains consistent\n",
    "        - subclass method doesn't strengthen input conditions\n",
    "        - subclass method doesn't weaken output conditions\n",
    "        - no additional exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Violating LSP\n",
    "- Syntactic incompatibility\n",
    "    - `BankAccount.withdraw()` requires 1 parameter, but `CheckingAccount.withdraw()` requires two\n",
    "- Subclass strengthening input conditions\n",
    "    - `BankAccount.withdraw()` accepts any amount, but `CheckingAccount.withdraw()` assumes that the amount is limited\n",
    "- Subclass weakening output conditions\n",
    "    - `BankAccount.withdraw()` can only leave a positive balance or cause an error, `CheckingAccount.withdraw()` can leave balance negative\n",
    "\n",
    "### Violating LSP pt. 2\n",
    "- Changing additional attributes in subclass's method\n",
    "- Throwing additional exceptions in subclass's method\n",
    "- No LSP - No Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing data access: private attributes <a name=\"two\"></a>\n",
    "### All class data is public\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restricting access\n",
    "- Naming conventions to signal that the data is not for external consumption\n",
    "- Use `@property` to customize access and allow you to control how each attribute is modified\n",
    "- Overriding `__getatrr__()` and `__setattr()__`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming conventions: internal attributes\n",
    "- `obj._attr_name`, `obj._method_name()`\n",
    "- Starts with a single underscore `_` $\\rightarrow$ \"internal\"\n",
    "- Indicates attribute or method isn't part of public class interface\n",
    "- Not part of the public API\n",
    "- Can change without notice\n",
    "- As a class user: \"don't touch this\"\n",
    "- As a class developer: user for implementation details, helper functions...\n",
    "- `df._is_mixed_type`, `datetime._ymd2ord()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming convention: psuedoprivate attributes\n",
    "- `obj.__atrr_name`, `obj.__mathod_name()`\n",
    "- Starts with double `__` but doesn't end with it $\\rightarrow$ \"private\"\n",
    "- Data is not inherited\n",
    "- Name mangling: `obj.__attr_name` is interpreted as `obj._MyClass__atrr_name`\n",
    "- Used to prevent name clashes in inherited classes\n",
    "\n",
    "*Leading **and** trailing `__` are **only** used for built-in Python methos (`__init__`, `__repr__()`)!*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties <a name=\"three\"></a>\n",
    "### Changing attribute values\n",
    "        class Employee:\n",
    "            def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "                self.name = name\n",
    "            def set_salary(self, salary):\n",
    "                self.salary = salary\n",
    "            def give_raise(self, amount):\n",
    "                self.salary = self.salary + amount\n",
    "            def __init__(self, name, salary):\n",
    "                self.name, self.salary = name, salary\n",
    "\n",
    "        emp = Employee(\"Miriam Azari\", 35000)\n",
    "        # Use dot syntax and = to alter attributes\n",
    "        emp.salary = emp.salary + 5000\n",
    "\n",
    "- Control attribute access?\n",
    "    - check the value for validity\n",
    "    - or make attributes read-only\n",
    "        - modifying `set_salary()` wouldn't prevent `emp.salary = -100`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restricted and read-only attributes\n",
    "![Restricted](imgs/restricted.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `@property`\n",
    "![Property](imgs/property.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Property2](imgs/property2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use `@property`\n",
    "- User-facing: behave like attributes\n",
    "- Developer-facing: give control of access\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other possibilities\n",
    "- If you do not add `@attr.setter` $\\rightarrow$ **Create a read-only property**\n",
    "- Add `@attr.getter` $\\rightarrow$ Use for the method that is called when the property's *value is retrieved*\n",
    "- Add `@attr.deleter` $\\rightarrow$ Use for the method that is called when the property is *deleted* using `del`"
