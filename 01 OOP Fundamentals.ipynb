    "# OOP Fundamentals\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn what object-oriented programming (OOP) is, how it differs from procedural-programming, and how it can be applied. You'll then define your own classes, and learn how to create methods, attributes, and constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OOP <a name=\"one\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedural Programming\n",
    "- When learning to code, it is common to write in **procedural style**:\n",
    "    - Code as a sequence of steps\n",
    "    - Great for data analysis\n",
    "- This gets difficult at scale\n",
    "    - The more data there is, the more functionality your code has, making it harder to think about it as just a sequence of steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thinking in sequences\n",
    "![Sequences](imgs/sequences.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead, we can view it as a collection of objects, and patterns of their interactions\n",
    "    - E.g. Like users interacting with elements of an interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "- **Code as interactions of objects**\n",
    "- Great for building frameworks and tools\n",
    "- *Maintainable and reusable code*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects as data structures\n",
    "- Fundamental concepts of OOP are **objects** and **classes**\n",
    "- Object = state + behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "![Object](imgs/object.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distinctive feature of OOP is that state and behvaior are bundled together\n",
    "    - E.g. Instead of thinking of customer data separately from customer actions, we think of them as one unit representing a customer\n",
    "    - **Encapsulation**: bundling data with code operating on it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes as blueprints\n",
    "- **Class**: blueprint for objects outlining possible states and behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "![Class](imgs/class.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects in Python\n",
    "- *Everything in Python is an object*\n",
    "- Every object has a class\n",
    "- Use `type()` to find the class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes incorporate info about **state** and **behavior**\n",
    "- **State** info in Python is contained in **attributes**\n",
    "- **Behavior** info is contained in **methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Attributes and Methods](imgs/attributes_methods.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object = attributes + methods\n",
    "- attribute $\\leftrightarrow$ **variables** $\\leftrightarrow$ `obj.my_attribute`\n",
    "- method $\\leftrightarrow$ **function()** $\\leftrightarrow$ `obj.my_method()`\n",
    "- You can list all the attributes and methods an object has be called `dir(obj)`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class anatomy: attributes and methods <a name=\"two\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### A basic class\n",
    "- To start a new class definition, you need:\n",
    "    - `class <name>:` starts a class definition\n",
    "    - code inside the `class` is indented\n",
    "    - use `pass` to create an \"empty\" class\n",
    "    - use `ClassName()` to create an object of class `ClassName`\n",
    "- For example, you can create an empty `Customer` class,\n",
    "\n",
    "        class Customer:\n",
    "            # code for class goes here\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even though this class is empty, we can already create objects of the class,\n",
    "\n",
    "        c1 = Customer()\n",
    "        c2 = Customer()\n",
    "\n",
    "- `c1` and `c2` are two different objects of the empty class `Customer`\n",
    "- We want to create objects that actually store data and operate on it\n",
    "    - In other words, have attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add methods to a class\n",
    "- Methods are functions, so the definition of a method looks just like a regular Python function\n",
    "    - method function = function definition within class\n",
    "- **use `self` as the 1st argument in method definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "        class Customer:\n",
    "\n",
    "            def identify(self, name):\n",
    "                print(\"I am customer \" + name)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ignore `self` when calling method on an object\n",
    "\n",
    "        cust = Customer()\n",
    "        cust.identify(\"Laura\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is self?\n",
    "\n",
    "        class Customer:\n",
    "\n",
    "            def identify(self, name):\n",
    "                print(\"I am customer\" + name)\n",
    "\n",
    "        cust = Customer()\n",
    "        cust.identify(\"Laura\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- classes are templates, how to refer data of a particular object\n",
    "- `self` is a stand-in for a particular object used in class definition\n",
    "- should be the first argument of any method\n",
    "    - So we can use it to access attributes and call other methods from within the class definition even when no objects were created yet\n",
    "- Python will take care of `self` when method called from an object:\n",
    "    - `cust.identify(\"Laura\")` *will be interpreted as* `Customer.identify(cust, \"Laura\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "### We need attributes\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: bundling data with methods that operate on data\n",
    "- E.g. `Customer`'s name should be an attribute of a customer object, instead of a parameter passed to a method\n",
    "- **Attributes**, like variables, are created by assignment (=) in methods\n",
    "    - meaning an attribute manifests into existence only when a value is assigned to it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add an attribute to class\n",
    "\n",
    "        class Customer:\n",
    "            # set the name attribute of an object to new_name\n",

    "- Refer to attributes in class via `self.__`\n",
    "- In previous sections, for each attribute we wanted to create, we defined a new method, and then called those methods one after another\n",

    "\n",
    "### Two Ways to define attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes in methods\n",
    "\n",
    "        class MyClass:\n",
    "            def my_method1(self, attr1):\n",
    "                self.attr1 = attr1\n",
    "                ...\n",
    "\n",
    "            def my_method2(self, attr2):\n",
    "                self.attr2 = attr2\n",
    "                ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        obj = MyClass()\n",
    "        obj.my_method1(val1)                             # <--- attr1 created\n",
    "        obj.my_method2(val2)                             # <--- attr2 created\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes in constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "        class MyClass:\n",
    "            def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):\n",
    "                self.attr1 = attr1\n",
    "                self.attr2 = attr2\n",
    "                ...\n",
    "\n",
    "        # All attributes are created\n",
    "        obj = MyClass(val1, val2)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If possible, try to avoid defining attributes outside the constructor\n",
    "- Your class definition can be 100s lines of code long, and the person reading it would have to comb through all them to find all attributes\n",
    "- Easier to know all attributes whhen they are created in the constructor\n",
    "    - attributes are created when the object is created\n",
    "    - *more usuable and maintainable code*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best practices\n",
    "1. Initialize attributes in `__init__()`\n",
    "2. Naming: `CamelCase`for classes, `lower_snake_case` for functions and attributes\n",
    "3. Keep `self` as `self`\n",
    "\n",
    "        class MyClass:\n",
    "            # This works but isn't recommended\n",
    "            def my_method(kitty, attr):\n",
    "                kitty.attr = attr\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use docstrings (displayed when `help()` is called on the object)\n",
    "    \n",
    "        class MyClass:\n",
    "            \"\"\"This class does nothing\"\"\"\n",
    "            pass"
